# SimulationsWiki
We are looking to build a Wiki that is specifically for "all things related to Simulations."  For establishing a set of parameters, we see Simulation as the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.  Simulation are used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance optimization, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games. We believe strongly that simulations can help humankind make better decisions in this rapidally evoling world.  Simulations Foundation, Inc. an NGO that has applied for 501c3 status, will be doing all it can to help create and promote quality simullations that are designed to improve man's life on Earth.  This wiki, to be placed at Simulations.wiki, will be used by the community to share information about simulations, and the individuals and companies that make simulations.
